In this lab, we will explore the concept of control effectiveness evaluation using a Streamlit application. This application provides tools for defining and analyzing operational controls, calculating control quality scores, and suggesting appropriate substantiation methods.

The application is divided into three main pages:

*   **Page 1: Introduction** - Provides an overview of control effectiveness evaluation and the application's features.
*   **Page 2: Define a Single Control** - Allows users to define a single control and calculate its quality score and suggested substantiation method.
*   **Page 3: Analyze Control Dataset** - Enables users to upload or generate a dataset of controls and analyze their effectiveness through visualizations and data tables.
